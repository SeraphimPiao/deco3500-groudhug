We are the team Groundhog and our work has been documented in the Wiki.


Our weekly work has been recorded in wiki pages which are named as that week(Week 6- Week 10).

Here is the link to the google drive of the team and all of our work such as PPT, transcript of presentation and user evaluation data are all in it. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12Pa0iFmsXK7mTdJk5OArbMq6O-xKobLm?usp=sharing  
Since our project is physical computing, so we have demonstrate video of our prototype for online present. Here is the link:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kw834AwkFTi-ayBSi1547G0x3simyW5-/view?usp=sharing  

The overview of our design process is also included in a Wiki page named as "Design Process Overview". It includes a synthesised process of how we have developped the prototype from ground up and the video of the final prototype.  
  
There is the structure of our Design Process Overview.
